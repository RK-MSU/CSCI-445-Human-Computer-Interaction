[TOC=1-4]

## Objectives

1. Examples of Human Factors
2. Learning from Bad Designs
3. Who’s to Blame for Bad Design

## Shape Coding

Modern day applications of shape’s affect on emotion (measure via arousal and valence).

## Of those ROADWAY CRASHES

Virginia Tech Transportation Institute: It was found that 78% of the crashes and 65% of near crashes had one form of inattention or distraction as a contributing factor – including inattention due to fatigue.

### Which is safer?

-  Hands-Free or Hand-Held Cell Phone
  - Hands-free – 3x more likely to crash
  - Hands-held – 3.5x more likely to crash

## As CS/Engineers - questions we continuously ask ourselves

1. How can we meet the 3 Human Factors aims(see right) between human and co-robot (computer- based system), human and car (becoming a robot on wheels) computational system , etc. ?
2. How can we measure this (efficiency, health/safety, satisfaction) objectively **_and_** subjectively?
3. Unintended consequences?

## Design of Everyday Things

1. Ask the user!
2. Observe the user!
3. Don't blame the user!

> The human component in system design is critical!

 
Many people think Human Factors is “easy”

- But...humanistic and mechanistic often do talk
- Some funny and not so fun examples to follow...

## Humanistic vs. Mechanistic – Silos at Work!

- **Humanistic**: they focus on people and remove the interaction with technology itself from the equation.
- **Mechanistic**: the technical sciences–engineering, computer science and applied math. Focus primarily on hardware and software; an understanding of human needs and capabilities isn’t part of the equation.

- These two types of folks rarely meet...
  - There are the artsy humanistic and the geeky technologists, right?
  - People tend to be educated to become one or the other

## Isn’t it just common sense? 

No! Here's why...

- ***Common sense stinks!*** If human factors principles are so easy to grasp, why are they always violated?
- Disasters continue to occur even with superbly engineered systems; common sense in engineering should prevent these "simple" problems
- People have great "common sense" in their hindsight but not in their foresight

## Let’s blame the user – yeah?

1. human factors
2. design flaws
3. materials failures
4. extreme conditions or environments,
5. combinationsof these reasons

## Human Factors in Health Care

- This problem isn’t just technology and the human, but a complex relationship work environment that includes
- However, it’s a work environment that doesn’t appreciate what we know about human beings.
