[TOC=1-4]

## Objectives

1. More Examples of Human Factors
2. HCI Design Requirements

## How do operate this BMW iDrive thing?

How do we know it’s designed properly?

TIP: iDrive allows the driver to control climate, the audio system (radio and CD player), the navigation s ystem and communic ation system.

- User testing, but who do we use and how do we test?
  - How = ***Observe*** & Ask - DON’T MAKE THEM THINK!
  - Who =
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Previous experience with technology
    - Education

## Fundamental HCI Design Requirements

1. Consider **every** potential user.
  - Look beyond young, technologically advantaged
  - Consider color blind, disabled, visually impaired etc.
2. As a computer ***scientist/engineer/designer*** you must **anticipate** common mistakes the user may make!
  - To do this, your users must be involved in the development and testing of your hardware/software.
3. **AND** – If the user makes an error **it** should not result in a catastrophic error!

## Who’s to Blame?

1. If the user makes a *mistake* it’s not the user’s fault, it’s a design flaw, not a human flaw.
2. Step back and think like a novice user, not a developer/designer. Of course, **you** know how it works!
3. Must meet with your users before, during, and after your design/development. ***Iterative Design***!
