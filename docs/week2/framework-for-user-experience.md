# Framework For User Experience

## Objectives

1. What is design and what is not?
2. Is there a Theoretical Framework for User Experience (?), why I’m glad you asked ;-)!
3. Why we can’t design the experience (?) and what we can do instead!

## Let’s Discuss User Experience/HCI Design Thinking...

HCI grew from - “psychologists interested in computer
technology and computer scientists interested in user
interfaces and user behavior” (Kaptelinin & Nardi, 2012)

## What is Design?

### What design is not!

**Design is Not Just “Lipstick on a Pig”**

- Not just changing how things look
- Or making things pretty
- Or designing graphics

TIP: User Experience Cannot Be Designed!

## Theoretical Framework for HCI

**manipulation, identification, stimulation and evocation**

TIP: Defining user experience using a research-based model (remember HCI is research based...)

### Hassenzahl’s (2010) Model

1. **Pragmatic**: how simple, practical, and obvious it is for the user to achieve their goals
2. **Hedonic**: how evocative and stimulating the interaction is to users

TIP: How users perceive a product, such as whether a smartwatch is seen as sleek or chunky, and their emotional reaction to it, such as whether people have a positive experience when using it. (Hornbæk and Hertzum, 2017)

#### Manipulation

- Hassenzahl explains the hedonic and pragmatic qualities with a hammer metaphor.
  - The pragmatic qualities are the function and a way for us to use that function.
  - However, hammers can also have hedonic qualities; e.g., if it is used to communicate professionalism or to elicit memories.

#### Identification

- Although manipulation is important, a product can have other functions as well.
  - Many of the items connected to you right now (say oh Twitter, SnapChat, Instagram) could probably be used to get an idea of who you are and what you care about.
  - The secondary function of an object is to communicate your identity to others. Therefore, to fulfill this function, objects need to enable users to **express themselves**.

#### Stimulation

- Pareto Principle and fighting for inclusion. Traditional usability says features should fight to be included.
- This is necessarily not the case with UX, because rarely used functions can fill a hedonic function called stimulation.
- Rarely used functions can **stimulate the user and satisfy** the human urge for personal development and more skills.

##### `Pareto Principle`

- 80% of work productivity comes from 20% of the time you put in
- 80% of errors are caused by 20% of code
- 80% of revenue comes from 20% of customers
- 80% of sales come from 20% of sales staff
- 80% of attention is spent on 20% of the web page

#### Evocation

- Recalling the past through memory.
- In design, we can certainly give a website a vintage look and feel to remind us of our childhood, high school or the ’60s… or the ’30s. But even websites with a modern and minimalist design can have evocative attributes.
  - Ex. Facebook provides you with a huge number of pictures from the past, some of which are highly evocative.

## SO, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, NOW, WHY CAN’T UX BE DESIGNED?

Because UX depends not only on the product itself, but on the _user_ and _the situation_ in which they use the product.

You cannot design the situation

You cannot design the user

We aren’t wizards

## What we can do...

We can design for user experience and rely on HCI
fundamentals to do so!

User Experience is the sum of certain factors, such as fun,
emotion, usability, motivation, co-experience, user
involvement and user engagement.

## In practice...

Who knows more about the healthcare needs of the elderly?

**Remember**:

- You cannot design the situation
- You cannot design the user
- We can shape neither our users’ expectations nor the situation in which they use what we have designed.

**But we can!**

Design the product or service, and we can have a _**certain kind of user experience in mind**_ when we design it. And _**we can measure**_ that experience in systematic manner to make it better one.
