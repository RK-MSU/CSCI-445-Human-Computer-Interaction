[TOC]

## How and when are we meeting?

By student demand and feedback from previous semesters -- this class will be
delivered in a “flipped classroom” manner, where a series of ”short and 
sweet” 15-20 min lectures will be delivered online via D2L asynchronously.

- Many studies show going beyond the 20-minute mark learners become fatigued, distracted, less  engaged, etc. and negatively impacts meeting learning outcomes. 
- There are several studies on why this format can be quite effective in terms of providing you a flexible and meaningful learning experience
  - And many believe (including myself), believe your future life long learning pursuits will be done  outside of the "traditional classroom". This means the use of videos, online certificates, use of  virtual/augmented reality, etc.

Physical class time will be reserved for time to ask me any questions 
(more on this to come)...

## What do I need to do?

Which means -- each week you will need to watch all
lectures and review the posted lectures notes provided for 
that week, you can watch/review these at any time during
that week.

By following this plan, you will ensure you don’t get left
behind and are **prepared for your assignments that line up**
with the lecture content.

## Do we meet physically in classroom with this “flipped classroom”?

- Physical attendance in class is **OPTIONAL**
- No bonus points given for attendance, but you also do not get penalized for not attending class.
