## Syllabus

### Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to human computer interaction for innovation in
technologies. Students will explore the core principles, methodologies, and applications of human-centered design
computing practices, in essence how may we “humanize technology” to empower our users and create a more
positive human experience. Example topics include: conceptualizing interaction, universal principles of design,
persuasive technology, dark designs (addiction, habit forming, persuasion), human perception and cognition,
immersive interaction (virtual/augmented/mixed reality), artificial emotional intelligence, experimental design and
statistical analysis, empathy and bias in interaction design, gamification, social interactions, and human-robot
interaction. Applications in manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare will be discussed. Explores course content
through a variety of case studies, assignments and discussions.

## Optional “Textbooks”

- Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction 5th Edition (ISBN-10 : 1119547253, ISBN-13 : 978-1119547259)
- The Human Factor, 1st Edition by Kim Vincente - Optional

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will:

- Effectively understand and communicate the relevance of the human centered design process in the practice of computer science.
- Be able to perform analysis, establish requirements, design and evaluate interactive computer-based systems and products with respect to the user.
- Analyze HCI issues in ubiquitous computing, robotics, virtual reality, multimedia, and web-based related environments.
- Acquire a basic knowledge about human cognition and relevant methodology.
- Apply an interactive design process and universal design principles to designing HCI systems.

## Late Policy

Assignments will be submitted through D2L unless instructed otherwise, and ***late assignments will be deducted 10% each day it is late***. Exception will only be given to extreme cases, like a student being sick with a Dr’s note. In this case, the student must contact me or the TA before the due date/time in order to get a delay in the assignment.

## Course Requirements

***Case Study Assignments (70%)***: The purpose of the case study assignments is to allow you to apply the human centered computing design principles learned over the course of the semester and to utilize the tools and concepts. These assignments are intended for you to use, develop, and perfect your problem solving and critical thinking skills. A description of the case study assignments will be given at least 7 days prior to their due date.

***Final Exam (30%)***: This will be a take-home exam posted via D2L during the last week of exams, you will be given 3-5 days to complete the exam.

## Grading

Work in this course will be graded to criteria. In other words, you won't be graded on a curve. Each deliverable is designed to test your achievement against one or more of the learning objectives.
